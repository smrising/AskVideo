 Here's how to film super cinematic talking head videos in 10 seconds. Start by turning off all lights so you have a completely dark room. Then turn on your key light and position it 45 degrees and slightly above your face. Next, get a small tube light to outline your body so you're separated from the background. Finally put some backlighting like a lamp or a big tube light so you don't look like you're floating in space. Make sure you save this video so you have it next time you film and drop a follow.
